    <p> My favorite movie is Raya and the Last Dragon. The movie is about the world of Kumandra where humans and dragons lived together in harmony. The harmony was disturbed when monsters, Druuns, threatened the land and the dragons had to sacrifice themselves to save human kind. 500 years later, the Druuns returned and now it is up tp Raya and the last dragon to stop them.</p>

    
    <p>The movie can be seen on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a> or at your local theaters!</p>
